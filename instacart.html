      <h2>Work</h2>
      <div class="spacing-padding-bottom--lg black-font">
        Instacartâ€™s toronto office is responsible for the B2B product  line of the company. 
        We onboard groccery retailers to our e-commerce platform, support their launch, and ensure the success of their
        white-label e-commerce solution with a toolkit of solutions. In this line of business, I was invovled in two groups of work:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Client support and feature requests
        <br />
        <br />
        My day-to-day work would include fixing reported client bugs and adding in new features. 
        A few of the features I worked on include: ensuring ADA compliancy in our retailer, adding in new delivery flow functionalities, 
        revamping the timeslot behaviour under pickup context, and so on. 
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Scalable and resuable frontend architecture 
        <br />
        <br />
        A new project was started to depreciate our Angular repository for widgets and create a 
        central React based repository where all the widgets would live for scalability and 
        performance improvments. During my time, I created the first succesful component refactor 
        and continued with several more during my internship.

      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
      <div class="spacing-padding-bottom--xlg black-font">
      The one thing that stands out to me during this internship was the amazing coworkers that I got to work with.
      Under a comfrotable and constructive environment, I learned so much from my colleagues under getting code reviews,
      doing code reviews and simple conversations as well.
