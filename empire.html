        At Empire Life, I interned as a web developer in the Innovation Lab, where I was a core contributor
        to bringing two projects to life: developing a chatbot to handle user queries 24/7 using React and Redux
        and designing a health dashboard with Figma that integrates Fitbit and GoogleHealth API. </br></br>

        I was a integral frontend developer in refactoring the existing codebase using Vue.js to React and Redux. From
        design, component achitecture and testing clients, I was able to wear multiple hats to contribute
        for this chatbot to be able to handle small to medium user queries with a robust backend using NodeJS and Firestore as our NoSQL database.
        Not only handling the present functionalities, I contributed to plan future features as well and so helped decide on Google's
        natural language processor (NLP). With the release of this chatbot, customer service representatives' workloads will be alleviated
        and support can be avaialble 24/7 to enhance customer experience.  </br> </br>

        During my internship, I was also the lead designer on the prototype of a health dashboard. My objective was to create a user-intuitive
        dashboard that displays relevant everyday health data for our clients. Carefully considering the client's age and vlaues, I created a
        prototype that introduces current design trends in a friendly manner to an older audience, being able to capture the young and older's attentions.
        I mocked several designs using Figma thinking of accessibility and responsive web design principles. Over time, the prototype project found success
        and is now drafting business use cases for future production state.   </br></br>

        Throughout the internships, our chatbot found favour in many of the VPs, SVPs, and other executives so our team gave several
        effective presentations to showcase our product. We as a team effective delievered and taught many of what a chatbot is
        and how our company should utilize it in the future. </br></br>
