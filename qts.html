      <h2 class="heading grey-color">My Role</h2>
      <p>QuickTapSurvey is a fast paced, survery software company located in the heart of downtown. As an intern analyst on the QA team, I was ensuring that our product was user-friendly on Android and iOS mobile platforms, including our company's web presence across browsers. 
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="heading grey-color">My Work</h2>
      <p>Although multi-tasking and detail-orientation may not theoretically go hand in hand, I balanced testing multiple OS versions and device models at once, while performing each of regression testing, load testing, and network testing. 
      <br />
      <br />
      My skills of communicating with different teams and indivuals grew. For example, listening to the marketing team, the customer success team, and development team to name a few, and understand their requirements and how their requests was incorporated within our testing as well. 
      <br />
      <br />
      I also carried out API testing via POSTMAN since QuickTapSurvey had many intergrations with others companies all over the world as well.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading grey-color">My Takeaway</h2>
      <p>I learned to ask questions and answer questions of my work with confident and ownership.
