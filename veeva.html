      <h2 class="heading grey-color">My Role</h2>
      <p>As a QA engineer, I was responsible for thoroughly ensuring that my given side-branch was defect-free, and worked well alongside other developing or developed branches with the current and previous release. I clearly identified numerous defects using Jira, Bash, and several VMWares in a timely manner, while also completing sanity and regression testing.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="heading grey-color">My Work</h2>
      <p>While ensuring the current release’s stability is crucial, managing legacy test cases and creating updated test cases are future investments pieces that will be invaluable soon as the product grows. I maintained portions of Veeva Network’s large test case bank, hosted through TestRail. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Another important aspect of testing at Veeva included, understanding the user requirements and testing in the point of the end-user, and not only testing for outliers and missed edge cases. Thinking in the point of the user and how this product would be used in a real-life basis allowed me to discover different testing routes and appreciate the work I was doing. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Lastly, I participated in a user study when they were gathering feedback for a redesign of a specific page. Thinking in the point of an internal engineer and possible client, I made remarks and asked questions related to accessibility, efficiency, and practicality. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading grey-color"> My Takeaway</h2>
      <p>I learned the one truly grows to like their work when they can appreciate how the product is going to impact real customers and their lives.
