      <p class="skills_content"> Working in the Technology & Operations department,
        I was part of an anticipated mobile device management (MDM) pilot rollout
        project that targetted 300+ internal CIBC end-users. By the end of my internship,
        this pilot was in a healthy state for mass-migration, targetting approximately 20, 000 end-users,
        and our team was going through the GO-NO-GO approval stage. My contributions
        included managing end-user issues,
        coordinating with different levels of support, engaging the operation and
        engineering teams, triaging issues with service owners, and weekly project meetings to ensure
        the success of the project was secured.</br></br>

        Not only, but with VBA and Mircosoft excel marco scripts,  I generated monthly analytical reports regarding
        Enterprise-Application usage data (including the service time, service location, service frequency,
        and many others). These monthly reports helped to graph a general trend of how the application
        was used throughout CIBC locations and ensure that the application was used to its full potential.    </br></br>

        I also contributed in composing a presentation for Service and Platform
        management's senior management and other managment teams who may have been
        interested. This deck gave a debrief of what MDMs were being deployed, the adavantages of them,
        and the related prospected spending reports. During this process, I worked with my director
        to present easily digestable data and using engaging visuals while following
        the outlined design principles within CIBC.
