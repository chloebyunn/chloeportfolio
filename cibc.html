      <p class="skills_content"> At CIBC, I interned as a business analyst in the
        technology & operations department, where my responsibilities included
        facilitating a mobile device management (MDM) project targeting 20,000 CIBC
        employees, and creating data visualizations through analyzing app usage.  </br></br>

        Before the MDM project was initiated, the internal tooling of the company was
        outdated and quickly becoming obsolete, with the enterprise MDM software being
        limited to Blackberry devices.  The goal of the project was to update this
        enterprise level software across the company.  By the end of my internship,
        the project was ready for mass-migration.  My contributions included managing
        user issues, coordinating with different levels of support, engaging the
        operation and engineering teams, triaging issues with service owners,
        and facilitating weekly project meetings to ensure the success of the project. </br></br>

        During my internship, I also generated monthly analytical reports through
        developing VBA and Microsoft excel macro scripts.  These reports were created
         with enterprise application usage data, and were designed to present data
         in an accurate, digestible format.  Over time, the reports were used to
         graph a general trend of how the application was used throughout CIBC
         branches, allowing the team to ensure the application was used to its full
         potential.   </br></br>

         Towards the end of the internship, I created and led a presentation for
         the Service and Platform team's senior management.  This deck presented a
          debrief of what MDMs were being deployed, the advantages of them,
          and the related prospected spending reports.  During this process, I
          worked with my director to create easily digestible data with engaging
          visuals while following CIBC’s brand guidelines. </br></br>
