      <h2>Role</h2>
      <div class="spacing-padding-bottom--md black-font">At CIBC, I interned as a business analyst in the technology & operations department, where my responsibilities included facilitating a mobile device management (MDM) project targeting 20,000 CIBC employees, and creating data visualizations through analyzing app usage.</div>
      <h2>Work</h2>
      <div class="spacing-padding-bottom--md black-font">
        Before the MDM project was initiated, the internal tooling of the company was outdated and quickly becoming obsolete, with the enterprise MDM software being limited to Blackberry devices. The goal of the project was to update this enterprise level software across the company. By the end of my internship, the project was ready for mass-migration. My contributions included managing user issues, coordinating with different levels of support, engaging the operation and engineering teams, triaging issues with service owners, and facilitating weekly project meetings to ensure the success of the project. 
        <br />
        <br />
        During my internship, I also generated monthly analytical reports through developing VBA and Microsoft excel macro scripts. These reports were created with enterprise application usage data, and were designed to present data in an accurate, digestible format. Over time, the reports were used to graph a general trend of how the application was used throughout CIBC branches, allowing the team to ensure the application was used to its full potential.
        <br />
        <br />
        Towards the end of the internship, I created and led a presentation for the Service and Platform team's senior management. This deck presented a debrief of what MDMs were being deployed, the advantages of them, and the related prospected spending reports. During this process, I worked with my director to create easily digestible data with engaging visuals while following CIBCâ€™s brand guidelines.

      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
      <div class="spacing-padding-bottom--xlg black-font">
        No one person can accomplish a project by themselves, but everyone has to participate in the project like it is their own.
